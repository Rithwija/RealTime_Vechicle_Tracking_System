# RealTime_Vechicle_Tracking_System
# Real-Time Vehicle Tracking System

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how a vehicle’s movement can be tracked using data analysis techniques. It walks through loading location data, cleaning it, analyzing movement patterns, and visualizing results. It’s a simple but practical starting point for real-world tracking systems used in logistics, transportation, and safety applications.

## What this project does
- Loads vehicle tracking data from a file
- Cleans and prepares the data for analysis
- Checks movement patterns like distance and speed
- Creates visualizations so you can understand how the vehicle moved
- Helps you build the foundation for a real-time tracking dashboard

## Why this project is useful
Tracking vehicles in real time is common in logistics, school bus monitoring, courier systems, and safety applications. This notebook shows how you can process and understand tracking data before building any advanced systems or APIs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used in the notebook)

## How to run the project

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
